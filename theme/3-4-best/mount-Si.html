<p>Mount Si is arguably the classic Seattle-area hike. It is the rocky peak looming to your left as you drive Interstate 90 past North Bend. It’s in the opening credits of the original Twin Peaks. Everyone at your office has probably hiked it at least once. All that notoriety also means it’s one of the most popular hikes in the area. <br> <br>

        Don’t let the popularity fool you; it’s a hard hike. It gains 3,150 in just four steep, switch-backing miles, but the views make it worthwhile. On a clear day, Mount Rainier will stand large to the south surrounded by dozens of other Cascade peaks.</p>
