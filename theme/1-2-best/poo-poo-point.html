        <p>Poo Poo Point is an open grassy knoll on the west wide of Tiger Mountain. Supposedly it’s named for the sound of train steam whistles that loggers could hear while working on Tiger. Looming above downtown Issaquah, it’s another urban hiking gem. Those that hoof it up the steep slopes are rewarded with great views of Lake Washington and the surrounding foothills. Paragliders use it as a launch point. Kicking back and watching them float through the air makes for a lovely mid-hike <br>

                Chirco Trail is the shorter way to Poo Poo Point. It’s only 1.9 miles each way. But covering the same elevation in fewer miles, of course, means it’s the steeper option of the two. High School Trail is the longer, but somewhat less steep option.</p>
